# supershot_turnovers
In the Suncorp Super Netball league(SSN), in the last 5 minutes of every quarter, players are allowed to shoot 'supershots' from a longer range, scoring 2 goals instead of 1. 
Many people discuss the risk/reward aspect of the super shot in terms of shooter accuracy. There is roughly a 50% chance of getting the shot in, and therefore it evens out. However, this is a very simplistic model. If a super shot is missed, three main things can happen: 
1. The team retains possession and attempts the supershot again
2. The team retains possession and decides to shoot in the ‘1’ zone
3. The ball is turned over. \\
I am looking mainly at scenario 3. Ideally, teams would want to be shooting more supershots than creating turnovers. 
I am looking at whether teams acheive this, and which teams do it better than others. Because the only way to create an accurate model surrounding the risk/reward factor of supershots is to look at it comparatively. 

I am using data obtained from Champion Data, accessible for free on the internet with https://mc.championdata.com/super_netball/index.html

I am specifically looking at turnovers resulting in attempts. This is because It is an easier data set to collect. There is not a lot of specific super-shot period data available and so this was the easiest way to collect data about turnovers quickly. 
Another data set neglected would be the number of turnovers resulting from the super shot period, involving getting in the right position. This would further paint the picture of the risk associated with the super shot. A potential way to start investigating would be to look at the proportion of turnovers in supershot time, compared to regular time.
